# ðŸ”’ Lock

Exclusive access control to shared objects through named locks.

## concept

objective: exclusive access to `object_name`.

1. read `object_name.lock`: if blank go to 3, else continue.
2. wait for `wait_for_clearance` (example: 3s), then go to 1.
3. write the random key `key` in `object_name.lock`.
4. wait for `wait_for_exclusivity` (example: 1s).
5. read `object_name.lock`, if the value is not equal to `key` go to 2, else continue.
6. exclusive access is established, process `object_name`.
7. write blank in `object_name.lock`.

## example use

```bash
@select
@lock lock . \
    --timeout 10

@lock lock . \
    --timeout 10
# failure expected

@lock unlock .
```
